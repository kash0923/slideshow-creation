# slideshow-creation
working on developing an auto and manual navigating slideshow for an institutional page utilizing Slate by Technolutions portal development... if anyone is familiar with that.
I've got another set of code(code 2) that doesn't have the aesthetic components that the first one (code 1) has included in it, but does have functional auto-navigation and manual navigation. 
Trying to piece the two together has been a task I can't seem to figure out. For Code 1 it seems the buttons exist, they are floating above the images and cycling through the buttons at the right interval, and respond when I click on the manual dots; but they do not seem to be interacting with the actual slide images, just the manual buttons.
I'm doing all of this based off of some videos and tutorials I've found on the internet. "Self-taught" is a stretch as I am not very much taught lol
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make code one utlize the auto-navigation buttons with the code that I've posted?
Thank you!
Kash
